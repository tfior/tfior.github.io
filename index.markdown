Originally from Pennsylvania, I moved to Italy in 2023 and have been living and working here ever since. After working for over a decade in office and warehouse management roles across several industries, I decided to return to school in 2020 to earn my bachelor's degree. In the spring of 2023, I graduated from Penn State University with a B.S. in Software Engineering and moved to Italy to re-claim my Italian citizenship. As a dual US/Italian citizen, I'm now free to work anywhere in the United States and the European Union.

Besides software development, my passions include photography, aviation, and auto racing.
